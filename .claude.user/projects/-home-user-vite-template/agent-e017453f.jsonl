I'm Claude Code, ready to help you with this Vite + React template project. I'm currently in **READ-ONLY planning mode**, which means I can explore the codebase and design implementation plans, but I cannot create, modify, or delete any files.\n\nKey points I've noted:\n- This is a React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui template\n- Running in E2B sandbox environment\n- Primary development target is `src/routes/index.tsx`\n- Must use `npm run check:safe` for validation (never `npm run dev`)\n- Should use shadcn/ui components first before building custom ones\n- TypeScript uses `@/` path alias and requires `type` keyword for type imports\n\nI'm ready to help you explore the codebase and plan implementations.
