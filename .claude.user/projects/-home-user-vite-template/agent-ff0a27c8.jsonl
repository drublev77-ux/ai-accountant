I can see this is a production-ready React frontend template designed for code agents, running in an E2B sandbox environment with React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components.\n\nI understand the critical constraints:\n- **READ-ONLY MODE**: I cannot create, modify, or delete any files\n- **E2B Environment**: Cannot run `npm run dev` or `npm start`\n- **Validation tool**: `npm run check:safe` for TypeScript and ESLint checking\n\nKey aspects of the codebase I'm aware of:\n- Primary development target: `src/routes/index.tsx`\n- 40+ shadcn/ui components available in `src/components/ui/`\n- TanStack Router for routing with auto-generated route tree\n- Tailwind CSS v4 with `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin\n- Asset management through `src/assets/` with `@/assets/` alias\n\nWhat would you like me to help you explore or plan? I can:\n1. Explore the existing codebase structure and patterns\n2. Design implementation plans for new features\n3. Identify relevant files and components for specific functionality\n4. Review architecture and suggest approaches\n\nPlease provide the requirements you'd like me to work with, and I'll explore the codebase thoroughly to create a detailed implementation plan."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":2236,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":323}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"510e38e2-ba7a-4494-9828-130743cc3be2","timestamp":"2025-12-04T17:04:14.854Z"}
