Your requirements/feature request\n2. (Optional) Any specific perspective you'd like me to apply (e.g., performance-focused, user-experience-focused, maintainability-focused)\n\nI'll then thoroughly explore the codebase and deliver a detailed implementation plan with the critical files needed for execution."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":2236,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":336}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"00395058-dfd0-4ee5-9d63-0ca15ccb4801","timestamp":"2025-12-10T17:58:31.172Z"}
