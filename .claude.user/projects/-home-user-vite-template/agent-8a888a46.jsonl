Please share:\n1. The feature/functionality you want to implement\n2. Any specific perspective or approach you'd like me to take during the design process\n\nI'll then thoroughly explore the codebase, understand existing patterns, and create a detailed implementation plan with the critical files identified."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":2236,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":285}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"14836c51-d76b-4814-aecf-309ef5ea2508","timestamp":"2025-12-10T13:11:06.577Z"}
