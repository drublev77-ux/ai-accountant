I understand I'm in READ-ONLY planning mode and cannot modify any files.\n\nTo get started effectively, I should:\n\n1. **Understand the current codebase structure** - I can see from the CLAUDE.md that this is a React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS project with TanStack Router and shadcn/ui components\n\n2. **Explore key files** to understand:\n   - The existing component library in `src/components/ui/`\n   - Current routing setup in `src/routes/`\n   - Available utilities and hooks\n   - Asset management patterns\n\nWhat would you like me to help you plan? For example:\n- Adding a new feature or page\n- Refactoring existing code\n- Integrating a new library or service\n- Planning a component architecture\n- Designing data flow patterns\n\nPlease share your requirements, and I'll thoroughly explore the codebase to create a detailed implementation plan."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":2236,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":230}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"3b1646dc-302f-407f-8109-d74f15725db8","timestamp":"2025-12-10T14:20:44.935Z"}
