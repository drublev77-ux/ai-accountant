I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore this codebase and create implementation plans. \n\nI see this is a React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS template with shadcn/ui components, running in an E2B sandbox environment. The project uses TanStack Router and Query, with a focus on building functional UIs.\n\n**Key constraints I've noted:**\n- ✅ **READ-ONLY MODE**: I can only explore and plan - no file modifications\n- ✅ **E2B Environment**: Cannot run `npm run dev`, only `npm run check:safe` for validation\n- ✅ **Primary Development Target**: `src/routes/index.tsx`\n- ✅ **Component Priority**: Use existing shadcn/ui components first\n\n**Tools available to me:**\n- `Glob` - Find files matching patterns\n- `Grep` - Search file contents\n- `Read` - Read file contents\n- `Bash` - READ-ONLY operations only (ls, cat, git log, find, etc.)\n\n**What I CANNOT do:**\n- Create, edit, or delete files\n- Run npm install, git commit, or any state-changing commands\n- Use file redirection or write operations\n\nI'm ready to receive your requirements and perspective. What would you like me to explore and plan?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":2236,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":304}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"cb1d5d13-ce88-4890-888b-f5ab13be0b03","timestamp":"2025-12-10T12:55:49.400Z"}
